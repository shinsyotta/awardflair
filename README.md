Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

    # Connect to your PickFlair account
    pf = PickFlair.new(api_key, api_secret, application_id)

    # Get a list of all the badges you have created on PickFlair
    pf.collect_badges

    # If you have already collected badges, this just gets that list again.  If you haven't, it collects them for the first time
    pf.badges

    # Get badge information using badge identifier
    pf.get_badge_by_identifier(badge_identifier)

    # Find a specific badge that you know you have created using it's name.
    pf.find_badges("Ruby Ace")

    # Award a badge via a link that you can provide to the recipient
    ruby_ace_badge = pf.find_badges("Ruby Ace").first # Choosing the first (and probably only) badge you have named "Ruby Ace"
    ruby_ace_badge.award # Returns a link that you can show to recipient so they can claim the badge.  

    # Award a badge by email (also gets you a link that you can give to the user.)
    first_badge = pf.badges.first # Getting the first badge you created.
